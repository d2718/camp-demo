A comprehensive battery of pretests was administered at the beginning of
the academic year to determine the student's current level of knowledge,
mastery, and capability. From this preassessment, an appropriate course of
study was laid out for your student. Please note that your student may
(based on pretesting) be reviewing some material already seen in a previous
academic year; this is not unusual, and an important part of the
mastery-based learning process.

## Basic Facts

In addition to the regular curriculum, your student's speed and recall
accuracy of the basic ``Math Facts'' (the results of the four basic binary
operations on whole numbers from 1 through 12) was assessed. Please note
that mastery of all four fact families is required for comlpetion of all
Middle and Upper School courses.
