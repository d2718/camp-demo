<h2 id="toc-users">Users</h3>

<p>
    There are four classes of user:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Admin</dt>
    <dd>The <dfn>Admin</dfn> is responsible for adding, removing, and updating
    users of the system; adding, removing, and updating courses, and
    maintaining the academic year calendar.</dd>

    <dt>Boss</dt>
    <dd>The <dfn>Boss</dfn> sees an overview of <em>all</em> students'
    progress, as well as the ability to send automatically-generated
    email messages to parents. (After Phase II is complete, the Boss will
    also have access to all student reports.)</dd>

    <dt>Teacher</dt>
    <dd>The <dfn>Teacher</dfn> has a comprehensive view of all students
    assigned to them (by the Admin), and can add and update their goals,
    Exam scores, and some other grade-relevant information. (After Phase II
    is complete, the Teacher will also have access to an additional tranche
    of report-oriented data and the ability to auto-generate, edit, and
    publish reports.)</dd>

    <dt>Student</dt>
    <dd>The <dfn>Student</dfn> has only the ability to view their individual
    pace calendar, progress, and score.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
    It is possible for a person to be more than one type of user; it is
    undoubtedly convenient for at least one Teacher to also be an Admin, and
    the Boss may also want Admin access as well. All this requires is that
    a person have a separate <a href="#toc-users-uname">uname</a> for each role.
</p>

<p>
    Each role needs to have a valid email address associated with it. This is
    how a user will set their password initially (and reset it later, if
    necessary).
</p>

<h3 id="toc-users-uname">User Names</h3>

<p>
    A user's identity is tied to their user name (or, as this system almost
    universally refers to it, their <dfn>uname</dfn>). They are uniquely
    identified by this uname, and their privileges and capabilities are
    determined by it. Unames may only contain alphanumeric characters and are
    case-sensitive.
</p>
<div class="center"><aside>
    A uname must match the regular expression <code>/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/</code>.
</aside></div>
<p>
    It is recommended to give staff the shortest and most convenient unames,
    as they will undoubtedly be logging into the system most often. As the
    system will probably only ever have around 100 users at any given time,
    no one should end up with a uname that's particularly confusing, obscure,
    or inconvenient.
</p>

<h3 id="toc-users-parent">Parent Email</h3>

<p>
    It is important that the Student have a valid parent email associated with
    them, as it is how the parents receive automated messages from the system.
    (It also ensures the parent can reset the password at any time and thus have
    access to their student's progress.)
</p>

<h3 id="toc-upload-students">CSV of Students</h2>

<p>
    Students can be added one at a time with the
    <button><label>add one Student</label></button> button; this is fine when
    a single new student enters the system, say, partway through the academic
    year, but in the fall when <em>all</em> the known students are being
    added this can be tedious. Students can therefore be added in bulk by
    uploading their information in a CSV file. The format of the file is as
    follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>One student record per line.</li>
    <li>Lines beginning with an octothorpe (<kbd>#</kbd>) are considered
        "comments" and ignored.</li>
    <li>Unlike when uploading student <em>goals</em>, columns may not be
        elided.</li>
    <li>Column order is:<br>
    <kbd>user name, last name, rest of name, student email, parent email, teacher uname</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at an example:</p>

<table class="csv"><tbody>
    <tr><td>#uname</td><td>last</td><td>rest</td><td>email</td><td>parent</td><td>tuname</td></tr>
    <tr><td>#</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>eparker</td><td>Parker</td><td>Elisabeth Elaine</td><td>e.e.parker@gmail.com</td><td>r.l.parker@gmail.com</td><td>jenny</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bpow</td><td>Powell</td><td>Brian</td><td>b.powwwwww@gmail.com</td><td>willy.powell@gmail.com</td><td>jenny</td></tr>
    <tr><td>wholt</td><td>Holt</td><td>Willa C.</td><td>willa@holt-info.com</td><td>kim@holt-info.com</td><td>jenny</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ck1</td><td>Cui</td><td>Kangyao (Kevin)</td><td>kangyao@gmail.com</td><td>nates.parents@email.org</td><td>irfan</td></tr>
    <tr><td>zmilk</td><td>Milkereit</td><td>Zack</td><td>zaxusername@gmail.com</td><td>dave.milk@gmail.com</td><td>irfan</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
    Note that the first two lines begin with <kbd>#</kbd> and are ignored.
</p>

<h2 id="toc-courses">Courses</h3>

<h3 id="toc-courses-sym">Course Symbols</h3>

<p>
    Each Mathematics course has a unique short chunk of letters and numbers
    that is used to uniquely identify it. This helps differentiate, for
    example, Honors Algebra I from the <cite>Prentice Hall Algebra 1</cite>
    textbook from Honors Algebra I from <cite>Discovering Algebra</cite>.
</p>

<p>
    The symbol, like the <a href="#toc-users-uname">uname</a>, is a
    case-sensitive string of alphanumeric characters. It should be reasonably
    mnemonic and should make sense as a representation of the course it
    represents. For example, Algebra I from <cite>Prentice Hall Algebra
    1</cite> has historically been <kbd>pha1</kbd>; the honors version of
    the same course has been <kbd>pha1h</kbd>.
</p>
<div class="center"><aside>
    A course symbol must match the regular expression
    <code>/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/</code>.
</aside></div>

<h3 id="toc-courses-level">Course Level</h3>

<p>
    The <dfn>course level</dfn> is mainly used to sort courses into a
    roughly chronological order. It should be a decimal number with the
    integral portion the grade level, and the decimal portion a vague
    representation of how "difficult" or "challenging" that course is
    relative to other courses at that grade level. For example, Core
    Geometry courses have generally fallen in the [10.0, 10.5) range,
    while Honors Geometry courses have fallen in the [10.5, 11.0) range.
</p>

<h3 id="toc-chapter-title">Chapter Titles</h3>

<p>
    Chapters are automatically named upon creation based on their sequence in
    the book, but you can rename them if you want.
</p>

<h3 id="toc-chapter-subject">Chapter Subject</h3>

<p>
    A chapter doesn't have to have a subject, but it's convenient for everyone
    involved (except you, obviously, who has to do the work of adding this
    information to the database).
</p>

<h3 id="toc-chapter-weight">Chapter Weight</h3>

<p>
    A chapter's weight is used by the Teacher's
    <button><label>autopace</label></button> function to size the chunk of
    time allotted to complete that chapter as a goal. By default, when
    a chapter is inserted (with
    <button><label>+ append Chapter</label></button> or
    <button><label>+ append N Chapters</label></button>), it is initially
    assigned a weight of 1.0. It's fine for an entire course to have each
    chapter weighted equally. When individually weighting chapters in a
    course, I generally assign a weight by counting the number of sections
    in the chapter and adding two.
</p>

<h3 id="toc-courses-upload">Upload Course File</h3>

<p>
    Adding a Course with the <button><label>add new Course</label></button>
    button followed by the <button><label>+ append N Chapters</label></button>
    button is fairly straightforward. However, if you want to customize the
    titles, subjects, or weights of each Chapter, this method can rapidly
    become tedious. Hence, the option to upload all the information about a
    course in a single text file.
</p>

<p>
    The file format consists of a <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a>
    header specifying data about the overall course, followed by one or more
    blank lines, followed by a CSV body for specifyhing data about each
    chapter.
</p>

<p>
    The TOML header has four key/value pairs (all requried):
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>title</code> (a string value)</li>
    <li><code>sym</code> (a string value, the
        <a href="#toc-courses-sym">course symbol</a>)</li>
    <li><code>book</code> (a string value, the texbook for the course,
        technically required, but it can be blank)</li>
    <li><code>level</code> (a floating-point number, the
        <a href="#toc-courses-level">course level</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The CSV portion has four columns: <code>chapter #, weight, title,
    subject</code>. All the columns except for the <code>chapter #</code>
    can be left blank, and a suitable default will be supplied. Blank lines
    and lines beginning with an octothorpe (<code>#</code>) are ignored.
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at a couple of examples. The Core Calculus course file looks
    thus:
</p>

<pre>
title = "Core Calculus"
sym = "c"
book = "Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic"
level = 13.1

# Last three columns are optional.
# Weights will default to 1.0, titles will default to "Chapter N", and
# subjects will default to nothing.
#
#chapter,   weight,     title,      subject
1,          8,          Chapter 1,  Prerequisites
2,          6,          Chapter 2,  Limits & Continuity
3,          11,         Chapter 3,  Derivatives
4,          8,          Chapter 4,  Applications of Derivatives
5,          7,          Chapter 5,  The Definite Integral
6,          7,          Chapter 6,  Differential Exqns & Modeling
7,          7,          Chapter 7,  Applications of Integration
</pre>

<p>
    As you can see, all of the Chapter data is explicitly defined here:
    chapter weights, titles, and subjects. The 6th Grade Heath Blue book
    course file has the absolute minimum amount of data specified (only
    the chapter numbers):
</p>

<pre>
title = "6th Grade Math"
sym = "6"
book = "Heath Blue Book"
level = 6.0

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
</pre>

<h2 id="toc-cal">The Calendar</h2>

<p>
    The Calendar tab has facilities for setting both end-of-semester dates,
    and specifying all of the "working days" available over the course of the
    academic year. Working day distribution is necessary for the Teacher's
    <button><label>autopace</label></button> function to work properly, and
    end-of-semester dates are necessary for semester grades to be calculated
    correctly.
</p>

<p>
    End-of-semester dates obviously get set with the input fields at the top
    of the tab; calendar working days are toggled by clicking and dragging on
    the calendar. Just make sure you click <button><label>save
    calendar</label></button> before navigating away from the page.
